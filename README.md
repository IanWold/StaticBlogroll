I'm a big advocate that everyone should be maintaining a blogroll. Not super actively - maybe more passively - but you should definitely have one. No doubt there's dozens of blogs a year you tune into - an article here to get help on an issue, an article there to learn about a topic, articles for fun or insight or curiousity.

How many of these blogs do you come back to? Probably not too many. It's a shame though, if an author had one useful article they've probably got a lot more coming; if they were insightful once they'll probably be insightful again. And I'll bet that if you find some interest in a blog, others will as well. Indeed, we should all publish our blogrolls!

Just about every blog has an RSS feed, but even so it can be a bit of a barrier to get and keep watching an RSS reader. That's the problem I found myself in: I added a bunch of blogs to the RSS reader on my phone and then never opened it!

This project is an attempt to lower the barrier and make it easier to both keep your own reading list and to publish it to help others discover the cool blogs you've found. Fork this repository, save your list of RSS feeds, and use GitHub pages to deploy a [nice, dapper page](https://ian.wold.guru/Blogroll/) showing off your blogs and their latest posts! If you're like me, you might be inclined to set this site as your browser's homepage to get a little reading in before the meetings start.

## Setup

It's easy to set up your own blogroll using this repo, though it does include a couple steps to configure GitHub appropriately:

1. Fork this repo
2. On your new repository, go to Settings > Actions (under Code and Automation) > General, and in the section Workflow permissions:
    1. Select `Read and Write Permissions`
    2. Check `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests`
    3. Click Save
3. Add an RSS feed to `Feeds` in `config.json` and commit it to test that the build works. RSS implementations can vary widely, and sometimes RSS files can be invalid. I like testing with `https://gizmodo.com/feed` because I know it's always well-formed. If the build worked, there should now be a `gh-pages` branch in your repository!
4. On your repositor, go to Settings > Pages (Under Code and Automation), and in the Build and Deployment section:
    1. Set Source to `Deploy from a branch`
    2. Select `gh-pages` as the Branch
    3. Click Save
5. Your site should deploy in a few seconds to a default URL. Navigate to this URL to ensure it deployed correctly.
6. You're done! Add all the RSS feeds you want, though be careful that invalid RSS files can cause the build to fail. Continue on this README for al lthe options you have for configuration, and then when you're happy share your blogroll with the world!

I would love to see what you make with this! Please feel free to open a discussion in this repo to show off your work, or if you aren't ready to show the world how awesome your reading list is feel free to [reach out to my directly](https://ian.wold.guru/connect.html) on any channel :)

If you get stuck anywhere please feel free to open a new dicussion on this repository, or search if someone's already had the same issue. I aim to respond within the next business day unless I'm out on vacation.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains all the configuration for the generated site:

* `Title` is the title of the generated blogroll site, both the page title (`<title>`) as well as at the top of the navigation bar.
* `PostsToShow` is the maximum number of posts from your RSS feeds to display on the "latest" page. Set to `-1` to show all posts.
* `CssUrl` is the URL to the CSS for your page. By default this is [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/), which I recommend because of its quality in styling plain HTML. This can be a URL to any CSS served via CDN, or to set this to your own CSS file put `yourfile.css` in the `Static` directory then set this property to `./yourfile.css`. Note that if your CSS requires any modifications to the HTML, you can update the templates in the `Templates` directory.
* `Pages` contains the title and subtitle settings for the Blogroll and Latest pages, which are the headings that display at the top of each page. You can write any HTML in these properties you like!
* `Feeds` is the set of links to your RSS feeds.

## Next Steps

This is very intentionally _not_ a product you install and host, but a repo for you to _fork_ and do your own thing with. It's a base canvas you can use and extend however works best for you!

### Files

* `/Static` Files in this directory are copied over to the root level of the output directory. You can include CSS, favicon, anything!
    * `Robots.txt` is the only file here by default. This controls how search engines navigate your site. By default it only includes `noindex nofollow`, which prevents search engines from listing the site.
* `/Templates` this includes the templates for the Blogroll and Latest pages, as well as a base layout which holds the containing HTML for each page.
* `build.csx` is the C# Script file that generates the static site. It reads in `config.json`, fetches and processes the RSS feeds, then uses [Metalsharp](https://github.com/IanWold/Metalsharp) to generate the site. You can edit this file to change any aspect of how the site is built. The site is deployed via GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow is defined at `.github/workflows/build.yml`; you can edit this file to change when the site is built or some aspects around its deployment.

It will run each day at midnight automatically, or when you push to the `main` branch. It sets up `dotnet` and `dotnet-script` so that it can run the CSX file. That setup is cached, so it will take longer to setup the first time but subsequent setups will only take a few seconds to fetch the cached files.

It then runs `build.csx`, which outputs the site to `/output`. The contents of that file are then committed onto the `gh-pages` branch, from which GitHub Pages will deploy.

## Contributing

Thank you for your interest, I would _love_ for you to contribute! If you identify a bug or a feature you want to add, please open an issue on it and we can figure next steps. I can't promise to include all features, my goal is to maintain this as a lightweight, super-easy way for folks to fork and get going.

If you've identified a bug and have a simple fix it's definitely alright to open a PR off the bat!
